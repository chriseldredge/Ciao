    <description>
        Provides targets for building .NET projects from scratch.
        Ciao bootstraps the build environment by fetching the latest
        version of the NuGet.exe command-line client, restoring NuGet packages
        for your solution, injecting version metadata into your assemblies,
        compiling the solution, running unit tests
        and building NuGet packages from your nuspecs. See the project URL
        for information on integrating Ciao with your projects.

        Note: do not install this package into projects. Install it at the Solution
        level.
