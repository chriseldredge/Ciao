Ciao
====

Provides targets for building .NET projects from scratch. Ciao bootstraps the build environment
by fetching the latest version of the NuGet.exe command-line client, restoring NuGet packages
for your solution, injecting version metadata into your assemblies, compiling the solution,
running unit tests and building NuGet packages from your nuspecs. See the project URL
for information on integrating Ciao with your projects.

To install Ciao, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

```
PM> Install-Package Ciao
```
